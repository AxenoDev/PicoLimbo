## Introduction

PicoLimbo is a lightweight [limbo server](https://quozul.dev/posts/2025-05-14-what-are-minecraft-limbo-servers/) written
in Rust, designed primarily as an AFK or waiting server. Its core focus is on efficiency by implementing only essential
packets required for client login and maintaining connection (keep-alive) without unnecessary overhead.

When idle, PicoLimbo uses almost no resources: 0% CPU and less than 10 MB of memory, making it extremely lightweight.

While not aiming to replicate every Minecraft server feature, PicoLimbo supports **all Minecraft versions from 1.7.2
through 1.21.8**, excluding snapshots, with only 28 implemented packets covering over 47 different protocol versions or
75 Minecraft versions.

## Features

### ‚öôÔ∏è Highly Configurable

Customize your server using a simple TOML configuration file, including welcome message, spawn dimension, server list
MOTD, and more.

### üîÄ Built-in Proxy Support

Seamlessly integrates with major Minecraft proxies:

- Velocity (Modern Forwarding)
- BungeeCord (Legacy Forwarding)
- BungeeGuard & BungeeGuardPlus authentication

### üéÆ Wide Version Compatibility

Supports all Minecraft versions from **1.7.2 to 1.21.8** natively, no need for ViaVersion or additional compatibility
layers.

### ‚ö° Ultra-Lightweight & Highly Scalable

Uses **0% CPU while idle** and under 10 MB RAM, enabling thousands of concurrent players thanks to Rust‚Äôs asynchronous
runtime and efficient design.
