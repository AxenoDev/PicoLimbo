An attempt at writing a lightweight Minecraft server from scratch in Rust. Currently, supports 1.16.2 up to 1.21.4.

## Introduction

This project is a lightweight Minecraft server written in Rust designed to serve as an AFK or waiting server. Its
primary focus is on efficiency, implementing only the essential packets required for client login and maintaining
connection (keep alive) without unnecessary overhead.

The server does not aim to replicate every feature or packet supported by Minecraft servers. However, it aims to support
all Minecraft versions from 1.7.2 up to the most recent ones.

This project only implements 23 different packets and aims to support more than 44 different Minecraft versions.
