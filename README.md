## Introduction

PicoLimbo is a lightweight [limbo server](https://quozul.dev/posts/2025-05-14-what-are-minecraft-limbo-servers/) written
in Rust, designed primarily as an AFK or waiting server. Its core focus is on efficiency by implementing only essential
packets required for client login and maintaining connection (keep-alive) without unnecessary overhead.

When idle, PicoLimbo uses almost no resources: 0% CPU and less than 10 MB of memory, making it extremely lightweight.

While not aiming to replicate every Minecraft server feature, PicoLimbo supports **all Minecraft versions from 1.7.2
through 1.21.6**, excluding snapshots, with only 27 implemented packets covering over 46 different protocol versions or
74 Minecraft versions.

## Features

### ‚öôÔ∏è Highly Configurable

Customize your server using a simple TOML configuration file, including welcome message, spawn dimension, server list
MOTD, and more.  
See the [Configuration](#-example-configuration-file) section for full details.

### üîÄ Built-in Proxy Support

Seamlessly integrates with major Minecraft proxies:

- Velocity (Modern Forwarding)
- BungeeCord (Legacy Forwarding)
- BungeeGuard & BungeeGuardPlus authentication

### üéÆ Wide Version Compatibility

Supports all Minecraft versions from **1.7.2 to 1.21.6** natively, no need for ViaVersion or additional compatibility
layers.

### ‚ö° Ultra-Lightweight & Highly Scalable

Uses **0% CPU while idle** and under 10 MB RAM, enabling thousands of concurrent players thanks to Rust‚Äôs asynchronous
runtime and efficient design.

## Getting Started

### üöÄ Pterodactyl (Recommended)

For users running the Pterodactyl panel, deployment is simplified with the provided [egg file](./pterodactyl/eggs). This
egg is built on the lightweight Alpine base image.

The egg supports additional installation configuration through the following environment variables:

- **VERSION**  
  Specifies the Git tag of the release to install. This can be a stable or prerelease tag (e.g., `v1.21.6`).
    - Default: `latest`
    - When set to `latest` (or left unset without enabling prerelease), the installer selects the newest stable release.

- **USE_PRERELEASE**  
  When set to `true`, the installer ignores stable releases and installs the newest prerelease based on publication
  date.
    - Default: *(empty)*

### üêã Using Docker

The Docker image is multi-platform, supporting both Linux/amd64 and Linux/arm64 architectures. You can start the server
using the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm -p "25565:25565" ghcr.io/quozul/picolimbo:master
```

You can also mount a custom configuration file:

```shell
docker run --rm -p "25565:25565" -v /path/to/your/server.toml:/usr/src/app/server.toml ghcr.io/quozul/picolimbo:master
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `master` tag image is updated on every push to the repository. For production or stable setups, consider using a
> fixed version tag instead.  
> A list of available tags can be found on the
> [GitHub Packages page](https://github.com/Quozul/PicoLimbo/pkgs/container/picolimbo/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged).

#### Using Docker Compose

A sample [docker-compose.yml file](./docker-compose.yml) is available in the repository. Download the
`docker-compose.yml` file and run:

```shell
docker compose up
```

### üì¶ Binary / Standalone

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure the `assets` directory is placed alongside the PicoLimbo binary, as it contains essential files required for
> server execution.

#### GitHub Releases

Download pre-compiled binaries for multiple platforms from
the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Quozul/PicoLimbo/releases). No Java or other dependencies are required.

#### Compiling from Source with Cargo

To build PicoLimbo from source, you can use Cargo:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/Quozul/PicoLimbo.git pico_limbo
```

## Documentation

### üîß Example Configuration File

A default configuration file will be automatically generated the first time you start the server.

```toml
# Server bind address and port
bind = "0.0.0.0:25565"

# Default spawn dimension: "overworld", "nether", or "end"
spawn_dimension = "overworld"

# Welcome message sent to players after spawning
welcome_message = "Welcome to PicoLimbo!"

[forwarding.velocity]
# Enable Velocity Modern Forwarding
enabled = false
# Shared secret for Velocity proxy
secret = ""

[forwarding.bungee_cord]
# Enable BungeeCord forwarding
enabled = false
# Enable BungeeGuard (requires BungeeCord to be enabled)
bungee_guard = false
# List of valid BungeeGuard tokens for authenticating incoming players
tokens = []

[server_list]
# Maximum count shown in your server list, does not affect the player limit
max_players = 20
# MOTD displayed in server lists
message_of_the_day = "A Minecraft Server"
# Show actual online player count in your server list?
show_online_player_count = true
```

### ‚å®Ô∏è Command Line Usage

1. Run the server:
   ```bash
   pico_limbo
   ```
2. Use a custom configuration file:
   ```bash
   pico_limbo --config /path/to/custom/config.toml
   ```
3. Enable verbose logging:
   ```bash
   pico_limbo -v  # Debug logging
   pico_limbo -vv # Trace logging
   ```
